# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Hesam!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial and System Engineering at Lehigh University. I am interested in discrete optimization and Machine Learning techniques. Currently, I am working on the intersection of Branch & Bound and Reinforcement Learning. Also, I am working on another interesting project which tries to verify the actions and behavior of Graph Nural Network through optimization.
