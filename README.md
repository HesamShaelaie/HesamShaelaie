# Hi there <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" height="28px" alt="hi">, I am Hesam!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial and System Engineering at Lehigh University. I am interested in discrete optimization and Machine Learning techniques. Currently, I am working on the intersection of Branch & Bound and Reinforcement Learning. Also, I am working on another interesting project which tries to verify the actions and behavior of a Graph Neural Network through optimization. If you want to know more about my work, please check out my [page](https://hesamshaelaie.github.io/).
